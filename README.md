# add-js - Because why should addition need to be synchronous?

Have you ever looked at **3 + 4** and thought,  
*“Wow, I wish this was a multi-threaded, asynchronous cloud event”?*

Well, wish granted.

**add-js** isn't just addition.  
It's a *promise* that one day, somehow, your addition operations will no longer block the main thread... because they’ll be too busy living their best *asynchronous lives*.

**Synchronous math is dead.**

Welcome to **Addition-as-a-Service**.

## 🚨 The Problem

In today's hyper-connected, always-on digital economy, every millisecond counts. Traditional **synchronous addition** operations, while once acceptable, now represent a massive risk to your system's scalability, responsiveness, and ultimate success.

When addition operations are synchronous, they **block the main event loop**, introducing devastating latency that cascades throughout your infrastructure. Every time your system pauses to add two numbers, you risk **clogging mission-critical threads**, **slowing down event handling**, and **bottlenecking user experiences**. Imagine thousands—no, millions—of addition operations queueing up, each one grinding your high-velocity microservices architecture to a halt.

**The result?** Increased server costs. Missed business opportunities. Sluggish user interfaces. Application instability. Brand erosion. Existential crisis.

🔮 Enter **add-js**: the asynchronous arithmetic revolution that *obliterates* traditional bottlenecks. By offloading addition to non-blocking, event-driven promises, **add-js** ensures that your core processing loops remain silky-smooth and hyper-responsive, even under catastrophic load conditions. 

Future-proof your systems. Eliminate addition-induced deadlocks. Embrace asynchronous excellence.

## 📈 Usage

Simplicity meets **enterprise-level scalability** in `add-js`. With a single call to the **asynchronous `add` function**, you unleash **rocket-fuel-powered performance** capable of handling the most **mission-critical environments**.

```javascript
import add from "@km5762/add-js";

async function run() {
  const result = await add(3, 7); // Powered by ChatGPT's **intelligent arithmetic algorithms**
  console.log(result); // Outputs: 10, achieved with **unmatched speed** and **zero-latency performance**
}

run();
```

Just like that, your **enterprise-class addition** operation is up and running with **AI-driven, lightning-fast efficiency**.

### 🔑 Setting up your OpenAI API Token

Before you can launch at full speed, you'll need to add your OpenAI API token:

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project if it doesn't already exist.

2. Add the following line to your `.env` file:

  ```ini

  OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
  ```

3. Replace "your-openai-api-key-here" with your actual OpenAI API key.

Without this step, the intelligent addition algorithms won't be able to summon their full AI-enhanced magic.
